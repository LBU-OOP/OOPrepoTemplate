## Component 1
### Weekly Exercises

Component 1 is worth 40% of the module but marked out of 100. It is assessed by weekly exercises.  
Each exercises should be completed by the beginning of the next week (ie. finish week 1 by the start of week 2), but with the flexible submission that gives an extra week (so week 1's work must be in by midday of the Monday of week 3), just go by the date posted.  
Each commit should be before midday (12:00) on the date posted in the exercises (xresults.md).  
To be marked you must ensure all of the following:  
* committed to your repository in the OOP GitHub classroom, it the correct directory.
* committed before 12:00 on the date given on xresults.md
* xresults.md (eg week1's is 1results.md) is updated with outputs from programs.
* Submission logged on the [OOP form](https://forms.gle/RiMroDpV1c1CTbHV9)
* You will be eligible for full marks for each week's worth submitted on time, you will be eligible for 50% of the marks if you hand in late but before the final assignment deadline (same deadline as component 2.)
