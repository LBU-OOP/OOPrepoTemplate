Each time you complete an exercise you must [record it on the Form](https://forms.gle/RiMroDpV1c1CTbHV9), the link is here and on each week's results sheet. 
This alerts us to the fact that you need something to be marked. 
Don't forget to click "submit" at the bottom after each completion of a set of exercises.
You won't be answering ALL the questions on the form each time, as all the exercises are on it. Just complete it for the week you have done and by the end you will have done it all.

You will be submitting to this form each time you complete an exercise. 
It will say "you've already responded", but there will be a link to "edit your response",
you should click it and go on with the form. Then click submit at the end of recording the current week's exercises.
